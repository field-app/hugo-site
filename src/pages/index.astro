            <h2>Current Recruitment Process is Outdated</h2>
            <p>
                Traditionally, recruitment has been plagued by intermediaries,
                limited visibility, and inefficient communication. Field is
                disrupting the status quo with a streamlined and transparent
                approach. Direct connections between athletes and recruiters, a
                diverse talent pool, all-in-one hub for recruitment, data-driven
                decision-making, and brand visibility are revolutionizing the
                industry. Field is ushering in a new era where efficiency and
                direct connections are paramount.
