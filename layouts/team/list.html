      "Subtitle" "We are a diverse and passionate team with a mission to help amateur athletes and college athletic recruiters maximize their potential on (and off) of 'Field'. Our vision is to revolutionize the recruiting landscape across college athletics, by building a socially-driven platform that enables amateur athletes to showcase their physical talents, personalities, etc. to an audience mainly comprised of recruiters from college athletic programs. The long-standing, archaic recruitment process still in place today is overly dependent on email exchanges as a means of communication between recruiters and athletes, and on word-of-mouth for discovering athletic talent in the first place. Our platform will serve to significantly optimize and streamline the outdated recruitment process that still persists as the norm in today's world of amateur athletics, and we can't wait to unveil it to you in the not-too-distant future! In the meantime, feel free to reach out to any of us if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hello!")
